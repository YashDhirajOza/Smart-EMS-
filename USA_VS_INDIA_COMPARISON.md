## 🎓 HACKATHON TALKING POINTS

### Opening
> "While most microgrid solutions are designed for Western markets, India's unique energy landscape—with coal-heavy grid (0.82 kg CO₂/kWh), ToU tariffs (₹4.50-9.50/kWh), and limited net metering—requires specialized optimization."

### Innovation
> "Our AI agent is trained specifically for Indian conditions, learning to maximize savings under real Indian tariff structures while minimizing emissions from India's carbon-intensive grid."

### Impact
> "For a typical commercial user, our system delivers ₹3-5 lakhs annual savings and reduces 100-150 tonnes of CO₂—equivalent to planting 450-650 trees—making it both economically and environmentally compelling for Indian adoption."

### Closing
> "This is not just a research project—it's a deployment-ready solution for India's growing renewable energy sector, supporting the nation's net-zero 2070 commitment."
